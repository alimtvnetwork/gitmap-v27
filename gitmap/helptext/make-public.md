# gitmap make-public

Make the current repository **public** on GitHub or GitLab.

```
gitmap make-public [--yes] [--dry-run] [--verbose]
```

## What it does

1. Detects the provider (GitHub or GitLab) and the `owner/repo` slug
   from `git remote get-url origin`.
2. Verifies that the matching CLI (`gh` or `glab`) is on `PATH` and
   already authenticated — gitmap does not store any tokens.
3. Reads the current visibility. If the repo is **already public**,
   exits 0 with no changes.
4. Prompts for explicit `yes` confirmation before going private →
   public. Pass `--yes` (or `-y`) to skip the prompt for scripts/CI.
5. Runs `gh repo edit <slug> --visibility public
   --accept-visibility-change-consequences` (GitHub) or `glab repo
   edit <slug> --visibility public` (GitLab).
6. Re-reads visibility to verify the change actually took effect.

## Flags

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip the "are you sure?" private→public confirmation. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the provider command that would run; do not invoke it. |
| `--verbose` | Echo every shell command to stderr before running it. |

## Examples

```
# Interactive (will prompt for confirmation)
gitmap make-public

# Non-interactive (CI / scripts)
gitmap make-public --yes

# Preview without touching the API
gitmap make-public --dry-run

# Debug auth or argv issues
gitmap make-public --yes --verbose
```

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success (or already public) |
| 2 | Not inside a git repository |
| 3 | No `origin` remote configured |
| 4 | Unsupported provider host, or unparseable owner/repo |
| 5 | Provider CLI missing, not authenticated, or apply failed |
| 6 | Bad flag |
| 7 | Confirmation required (re-run with `--yes`) |
| 8 | Verification failed (visibility did not change) |
